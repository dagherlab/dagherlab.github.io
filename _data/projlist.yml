  description: Excess weight in adulthood leads to health complications such as diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. Recently, excess weight has also been related to brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Reports show that obesity is linked with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related changes, such as cerebrovascular damage or amyloid-β accumulation. However, to date no research has conducted a direct comparison between brain atrophy patterns in AD and obesity.

  description: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a parasomnia characterized by abnormal movements and vocalizations during REM sleep that typically develops into dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). As a prodromal synucleinopathy, iRBD patients show brain changes like those seen in manifest synucleinopathies. In particular, brain atrophy has been shown to occur in iRBD patients, which correlates with clinical changes, especially cognitive impairment, and can even predict the phenoconversion to DLB compared to PD. However, to date, the mechanisms underlying the development of brain atrophy and its patterns in iRBD remain poorly understood.

  description: Networks of white matter fibers projections form polyfunctional neural circuits that support cognition. We study how the structural organization of the brain supports emergent neural dynamics. We are primarily interested in how structure-function coupling varies across the cortical hierarchy, how it depends on local micro-architecture, and how it varies across time.
