  description: Excess weight in adulthood leads to health complications such as diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. Recently, excess weight has also been related to brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Reports show that obesity is linked with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related changes, such as cerebrovascular damage or amyloid-β accumulation. However, to date no research has conducted a direct comparison between brain atrophy patterns in AD and obesity.

  description: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a parasomnia characterized by abnormal movements and vocalizations during REM sleep that typically develops into dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). As a prodromal synucleinopathy, iRBD patients show brain changes like those seen in manifest synucleinopathies. In particular, brain atrophy has been shown to occur in iRBD patients, which correlates with clinical changes, especially cognitive impairment, and can even predict the phenoconversion to DLB compared to PD. However, to date, the mechanisms underlying the development of brain atrophy and its patterns in iRBD remain poorly understood.

  description: Atrophy has been reported in multiple brain regions, even in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease. However, less is known about the progression of tissue loss after diagnosis. There have been a few studies of MRI-derived measures over time, but they were limited by small sample sizes, short follow-up durations or use of global volumetric measures. The most consistent findings are subcortical tissue loss early on, notably affecting striatum, thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus, and more widespread cortical atrophy when longer durations or larger sample sizes are used. With few exceptions, no study has attempted to relate the spatial pattern of atrophy progression to intrinsic properties of the brain, such as anatomical connectivity, cellular composition or regional gene expression. Such an analysis could provide information about pathophysiological mechanisms in Parkinson’s disease.
