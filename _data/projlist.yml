  description: Excess weight in adulthood leads to health complications such as diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. Recently, excess weight has also been related to brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Reports show that obesity is linked with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related changes, such as cerebrovascular damage or amyloid-β accumulation. However, to date no research has conducted a direct comparison between brain atrophy patterns in AD and obesity.

  image: res_RBD.png
  description: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a parasomnia characterized by abnormal movements and vocalizations during REM sleep that typically develops into dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). As a prodromal synucleinopathy, iRBD patients show brain changes like those seen in manifest synucleinopathies. In particular, brain atrophy has been shown to occur in iRBD patients, which correlates with clinical changes, especially cognitive impairment, and can even predict the phenoconversion to DLB compared to PD. However, to date, the mechanisms underlying the development of brain atrophy and its patterns in iRBD remain poorly understood.

  description: Networks of white matter fibers projections form polyfunctional neural circuits that support cognition. We study how the structural organization of the brain supports emergent neural dynamics. We are primarily interested in how structure-function coupling varies across the cortical hierarchy, how it depends on local micro-architecture, and how it varies across time.

  description: How does connectome architecture shape computation? We are constructing bio-instantiated artificial neural networks by implementing real biological brain connectomes as artificial networks. Using realistic biophysical dynamics and connection patterns, we are developing neuromorphic reservoir computers - connectomes that can be trained to perform cognitive tasks, such as working memory, language comprehension, spatial navigation.

  description: Axonal fibers provide a scaffold through which misfolded pathogenic proteins spread, shaping the course and expression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s (PD) and Alzheimer’s (AD) disease.  We develop generative models that integrate connectivity (diffusion MRI), co-activation (functional MRI) and genetics (mRNA transcription) to predict the evolution of neurodegenerative diseases.

  image: res_stat.png
  description: An emerging theme in network neuroscience emphasizes links between multiscale structural and functional features of the brain, and the rich cognitive-behavioural repertoire they support. We develop multivariate statistical learning techniques that map high-dimensional brain imaging modalities to phenotypic variation in healthy and clinical populations.

- title: "Null Models"
  image: res_null.png
  description: How do we demonstrate that a brain network feature is statistically unexpected? Null models are an inferential tool to assess the presence or magnitude of features, by selectively preserving specific architectural properties of brain networks while randomizing others. We develop and systematically benchmark null models to understand the architecture of brain networks.

- title: "Network Communication"
  image: res_comm.png
  description: A fundamental question in connectomics is how the organization of brain networks supports neural signaling. Using anatomically realistic brain networks derived from imaging and tracing, we develop computational models of inter-regional communication. We use these models to characterize how communication processes unfold on structural brain networks and how they support cognitive capacity.
